Say hello to Paradigm Shift, my first addition to HTML5 UP in more than a year (!!!).
Took things in a slightly different direction with this one, partly to mess with CSS
grid (which this one relies on pretty heavily) but mostly to get back to making weirder
and more experimental designs/layouts. Anyway, hope you dig it, and thanks for the
continued support despite the lack of updates :)

## Welcome to my Github profile.

What am I doing right now? I am doing the #100daysofcode challenge while looking for a job. 

Checkout my daily progresses [here](https://github.com/thatvetdevrob/Daily_Code_Repo)

Aside from finishing the 401 Code Fellows Advanced JS course, im also thiking about improving my online portfolio. Right now my portfolio has a lot of individual pieces coming togethere: all the emails from bings ads were done by me and used with permision of my supervisors both at TCS and Microsoft, and eventually i will migrate some code fellows projects on to it, depending on when I want to use some of my 100daysofcode and polish that.  
 
[Check out my site](https://thatvetdevrob.com/)

If you are an employer looking for a Junior UI/front end dev with some experience already, you should really consider me.
