## Welcome to my Github profile; I am an SFMC email marketing developer.

#### What am I working on right now?

Hi, right now I am updating my portfolio to show potential employers my skills *but* I would like to make you aware that I am currently working at Go Daddy as a SFMC email marketing specialist as a contractor with the possibility of being hired. I already have 4+ years of experince and have found my "niche" as a web developer.

- I am good with amp-script.
- I am so fast that not only does my Go Daddy value me so as to me constantly getting shoutouts from my team, they trust my work enough to gradually increase my responsibilities.
- Would not dream of leaving unless a good position came about with around no less than $55/hr and comparable benefits to my current position. 

#### What are my strenghts?

My speed is incredible, but not only can I manage the creation of email campaigns and see them thru end to end, I do so accurately and I follow the guidelines in every email campaign assigned to me using Jira atm. If you ever need someone that: just “puts their head down and cooks” away all of your backlogged campaigns, can create the responsiveness needed using amp-script to connect the email content to the Data Extension fields, and loves attention to detail with ample follow up thru the whole process consider sending me a message.


#### Update History

June 9th: Added more copy and laying out some of the structure fo the portfolio. Will be looking at next adding the examples of my own work to the right places. 

Its June the 7th as I write this and look forward to add more as I manage my job and free time... outside of work, I am a veteran who grew up in a rural farming environment and now works in email marketing: life is full of fun twists and turns.
