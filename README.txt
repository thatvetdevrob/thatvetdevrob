## Welcome to my Github profile.

What am I doing right now? I am doing the #100daysofcode challenge while looking for a job. 

Checkout my daily progresses [here](https://github.com/thatvetdevrob/Daily_Code_Repo)

Aside from finishing the 401 Code Fellows Advanced JS course, im also thiking about improving my online portfolio. Right now my portfolio has a lot of individual pieces coming togethere: all the emails from bings ads were done by me and used with permision of my supervisors both at TCS and Microsoft, and eventually i will migrate some code fellows projects on to it, depending on when I want to use some of my 100daysofcode and polish that.

If you are an employer looking for a Junior UI/front end dev with some experience already, you should really consider me.
